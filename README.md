# classesAda
These are the exercises I do in every bootcamp class to practice. 
I guess that practicing means everything when you are learning to code so don't judge me for my mistakes and eccentric taste.
I'll be adding in this README what I've been doing in each folder inside this repository.
Although, I should tell you first that ADA is a front-end bootcamp so don't expect weird and cool back-end stuff.
Let's save that magic for the future.
